Becoming a data engineer involves acquiring a combination of technical skills, domain knowledge, and practical experience. Here's a roadmap to guide you on what to learn to become a data engineer:

Programming Languages:

Python or Java: Learn one of these languages as they are commonly used in data engineering tasks.
SQL:

Master SQL for querying and managing databases. This is a fundamental skill for any data engineer.
Databases:

Understand both relational databases (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle) and non-relational databases (e.g., MongoDB, Cassandra). Know how to design and optimize database schemas.
Big Data Technologies:

Learn about distributed computing and big data technologies like Apache Hadoop, Apache Spark, and Apache Flink.
Data Modeling:

Understand data modeling concepts, including entity-relationship diagrams (ERD) and schema design.
ETL (Extract, Transform, Load):

Familiarize yourself with ETL processes and tools. Common tools include Apache NiFi, Apache Airflow, Talend, and Informatica.
Data Warehousing:

Learn about data warehousing concepts and tools like Amazon Redshift, Google BigQuery, Snowflake, and Apache Hive.
Data Integration:

Understand how to integrate data from various sources. This involves data cleansing, transformation, and loading (ETL).
Version Control:

Use version control systems like Git to manage and track changes in your codebase.
Cloud Platforms:

Gain proficiency in at least one cloud platform (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud). Learn how to deploy and manage data engineering solutions in the cloud.
Containerization and Orchestration:

Understand containerization tools like Docker and orchestration tools like Kubernetes. These technologies are increasingly important in modern data engineering workflows.
Data Quality and Testing:

Learn about data quality assurance and testing methodologies to ensure the accuracy and reliability of data.
Monitoring and Logging:

Familiarize yourself with tools for monitoring and logging to track the performance and health of your data pipelines.
Collaboration and Documentation:

Develop good practices for collaboration using tools like Jira or Trello. Document your code, processes, and decisions effectively.
Continuous Learning:

Stay updated on the latest developments in the field. Follow blogs, participate in forums, and attend conferences related to data engineering.
Soft Skills:

Develop communication skills to effectively collaborate with data scientists, analysts, and other stakeholders. Being able to communicate technical concepts to non-technical audiences is crucial.
Remember that hands-on experience is invaluable. Work on real-world projects, contribute to open-source projects, and seek internships or entry-level positions to apply and reinforce your knowledge.
